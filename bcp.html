    <h1>Business Continuity Plan (BCP)</h1>
    <p>
      A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is a master strategy designed to ensure that
      <strong>critical business operations</strong> continue with minimal interruption,
      even amidst disruptive events such as <em>natural disasters</em>, <em>cyberattacks</em>,
      or <em>supply chain failures</em> (JPMorgan, 2025).
    </p>
    <p>
      BCPs are inherently broader than Disaster Recovery Plans, since BCPs encompass all facets
      of an organization: technology, personnel, facilities, and third-party relationships (TraceSecurity, 2023).
      By proactively identifying potential threats and establishing comprehensive procedures
      (including relocation, manual workarounds, and leadership roles), a robust BCP minimizes
      financial losses and reputational harm.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Key Components:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Business Impact Analysis (BIA)</em>: Evaluates vital processes, estimates financial
          and operational damage, and categorizes business functions by priority.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Continuity Strategies</em>: May include alternate sites, remote work policies,
          or redundant suppliers to safeguard essential operations (CrashPlan, 2023).
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Crisis Management & Communication Plan</em>: Outlines swift escalation protocols
          and stakeholder notifications (e.g., employees, customers, regulators).
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Organizational Roles & Hierarchy</em>: Assigns accountability for decision-making,
          resource allocation, and plan activation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Testing & Training</em>: Ongoing drills that validate continuity procedures and
          cultivate a culture of resilience within the organization.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Importance to IT Auditing:</strong>
      Auditors look for evidence that the BCP is regularly updated and tested, ensuring it 
      integrates effectively with the Disaster Recovery Plan (JPMorgan, 2025).
      They also confirm compliance with relevant regulations (ISO 22301, FFIEC guidelines)
      and verify whether management has adequately documented risk assessments
      and recovery strategies.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to <strong>JPMorgan (2025)</strong>, a well-structured BCP
      includes details on responsible parties, recovery methodologies, and ongoing testing
      protocols. The overarching goal is to maintain functional operations, even if IT systems
      are partially or entirely offline, by establishing clear pathways for employees to follow
      until normalcy is restored.
