    <h1>Welcome to My Recovery Plans Comparison Blog</h1>
    <p>
      This blog is dedicated to exploring three essential components of organizational resilience:
      <strong>Disaster Recovery Plans (DRP)</strong>,
      <strong>Business Continuity Plans (BCP)</strong>,
      and <strong>Incident Response Plans (IRP)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through these pages, you will find detailed insights and master’s-level analyses on how each plan functions,
      how they interrelate, and why they are critical to both <strong>IT auditing</strong> and overall
      organizational success. We also highlight best practices from multiple sources, including guidance
      from NIST, FFIEC, and real-world experts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please use the navigation links above to learn more about each plan individually, compare them side-by-side,
      or read about the context of this assignment in the “About Me” section.
    </p>

      This blog is part of Assignment 2, Part V, for the CECS 6230-80 course at the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico,
      under the guidance of Professor Dr. Cruz.
