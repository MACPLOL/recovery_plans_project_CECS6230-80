    <h1>Comparison of DRP, BCP, and IRP</h1>

    <p>
      Although the <strong>Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)</strong>, 
      <strong>Business Continuity Plan (BCP)</strong>, 
      and <strong>Incident Response Plan (IRP)</strong> share
      interdependent goals, each focuses on different dimensions of preparedness
      and response. At a high level:

    <h2>Holistic Integration</h2>
    <p>
      In practice, <strong>DRP</strong>, <strong>BCP</strong>, and <strong>IRP</strong>
      are most effective when seamlessly integrated. For example, a small security incident
      might be contained solely via IRP procedures. However, if the attack escalates to a
      full-scale system outage, the <em>DRP</em> becomes crucial in restoring affected systems.
      Simultaneously, if the outage threatens the entire organization’s ability to function,
      the <em>BCP</em> ensures essential operations continue through alternate sites or manual
      processes (TraceSecurity, 2023; CrashPlan, 2023).
    </p>
    <p>
      Organizations achieving “mature” resilience typically unify these plans under an
      overarching governance model, recognizing that while the DRP’s technical
      recovery procedures are distinct from the BCP’s enterprise-wide continuity strategies
      and the IRP’s immediate threat response tasks, all three frameworks share
      a common goal: preserving operational stability and protecting critical assets.
