    <h1>Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)</h1>
    <p>
      A Disaster Recovery Plan is a documented, systematic approach to
      <strong>restoring critical IT systems, data, and infrastructure</strong> following
      events such as natural disasters, cyberattacks, or major system failures (CrashPlan, 2023).
      The principal objective is to minimize downtime and protect organizational assets
      from permanent loss.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modern organizations face considerable risk from both physical and cyber threats.
      In the context of an IT environment, data unavailability or corruption can lead to severe
      financial and reputational harm. A DRP provides a roadmap on how to reinstate mission-critical
      operations rapidly, often involving <strong>backup and restoration procedures</strong>,
      alternate sites, or cloud-based contingencies.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Key Components:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Risk Assessment & Business Impact Analysis</em>: Identifies potential threats
          (e.g., fires, cyberattacks) and their operational impact on technology and data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) & Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)</em>:
          Defines acceptable downtime (RTO) and allowable data loss in time (RPO) (CrashPlan, 2023).
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Resource Inventory & Backup Procedures</em>: Ensures redundancy of assets
          (servers, networks, and data), with an emphasis on geographically separated backups.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Roles & Responsibilities</em>: Establishes a crisis management team and
          identifies who activates DR processes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Testing & Updating</em>: Routine drills (annual or semi-annual) confirm
          the DRP’s effectiveness, with lessons learned feeding into plan revisions.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Importance to IT Auditing:</strong> 
      Auditors ensure the DRP aligns with industry standards
      (e.g., NIST 800-34) and meets compliance requirements (TraceSecurity, 2023).
      They also verify that backups are valid, offsite storage procedures are followed,
      and RTO/RPO parameters are realistically tested. Disaster Recovery is
      often considered a <strong>subset of broader Business Continuity</strong> initiatives
      but zeroes in on IT restoration and data availability.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to the <strong>FFIEC IT Business Continuity Management Booklet</strong>, DR
      emphasizes restoring essential IT infrastructure and data repositories. Management should
      identify the key business processes that depend on these systems, prioritize their
      recovery order, and define how the organization returns to a “normalized state”
      (TraceSecurity, 2023).
