    <h1>Incident Response Plan (IRP)</h1>
    <p>
      An Incident Response Plan (IRP) outlines how an organization prepares for, detects,
      contains, and recovers from <strong>security incidents</strong>, ranging from malware
      outbreaks to insider threats (TraceSecurity, 2023).
      The IRP aims to safeguard data confidentiality, integrity, and availability while
      minimizing legal and reputational harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to <strong>CISA (2025)</strong>, an effective IRP clarifies roles and
      responsibilities, provides guidelines for key activities, and ensures that the right
      people are engaged before, during, and after a suspected incident. Training and
      tabletop exercises are fundamental for ensuring incident readiness and improving
      organizational coordination.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Key Components:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Incident Detection & Monitoring</em>: Systems like SIEM and IDS to flag anomalies.</li>
        <li><em>Roles & Responsibilities</em>: A dedicated incident response team authorized to take
            rapid containment measures.</li>
        <li><em>Containment, Eradication, & Recovery</em>: Steps to isolate affected systems,
            remove malicious code, and restore normal operations.</li>
        <li><em>Communication & Escalation Procedures</em>: Notification of executive
            leadership, regulators, and law enforcement (when appropriate).</li>
        <li><em>Post-Incident Review & Lessons Learned</em>: Blameless retrospectives that
            drive continuous improvement (CISA, 2025).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Importance to IT Auditing:</strong>
      From an audit perspective, the IRP must be consistently tested and updated in line with
      emerging threats. Auditors verify alignment with frameworks like NIST SP 800-61 and
      review whether <strong>escalation thresholds</strong> (who is contacted, and when) are
      well-defined (TraceSecurity, 2023).
      The IRP’s link to DRP and BCP is also crucial; if an incident escalates significantly,
      the organization may need to activate both disaster recovery measures and broader
      business continuity procedures.
